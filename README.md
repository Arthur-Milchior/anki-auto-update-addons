# Update add-ons at start
## Rationale
I don't want to have to think about updating my add-ons. So this
add-on does it when I load a profile.

It uses the same process for updating as Anki. That is, it updates
only add-ons installed using the add-on manager. And you can decide to
update all or none of the add-ons.

## Warning
If your computer is off-line, you'll see a tooltip stating no update
occurs.

This add-on uses Anki's default update method, and so has the same limitation:
it only updates all or none of the add-ons.

## Technical
Ideally, I'd like this to run when Anki loads. It makes no sense to do
it when loading a profile. However, the add-on manager is entirely
front-end, and requires the use of the main window, hence it requires
a profile to be loaded.

## Version 2.0
None

## TODO
* A configuration option to synchronize add-ons while you synchronize
the collection.
* Being able to synchronize only some add-ons.
